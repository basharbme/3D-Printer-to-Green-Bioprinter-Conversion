# 3D-Printer-to-Green-Bioprinter-Conversion

Welcome to my Green Bioprinter Conversion repository! This is the place where you can find all CAD files in their original format (OpenSCAD & AutoDesk Inventor), in the .stl-format and also their matching engineering drawings. 

In this README file you will also find all necessary links to related websites. 

Feel free to create branches and commit pull requests. If you have any questions with the overall project just go ahead and message me. 

Happy Green Bioprinting!

# 3D-Printer-to-Green-Bioprinter-Conversion

Welcome to my Green Bioprinter Conversion repository! This is the place where you can find all CAD files in their original format (OpenSCAD & AutoDesk Inventor), in the .stl-format and also their matching engineering drawings. There will also be a list of the components I used and maybe a step by step conversion guide as soon as I manage to write one. If you canÂ´t find it yet, refer to the first link, which is the guide to conversion done by another group (iGEM Team Munich 2016). It is a little different, because I adapted some parts and designed some new ones, but the general principle is very similar.

In this README file you will also find all necessary links to related websites. 

Feel free to create branches and commit pull requests. If you have any questions with the overall project just go ahead and message me. 

Happy Green Bioprinting!


Links:

First off I will place the link to the website of the Munich iGEM group of 2016, because I benefited a lot of their previous work.

iGEM: http://2016.igem.org/Team:LMU-TUM_Munich/Hardware

Here you will find everything regarding their conversion. 

Next up is the link to tinkerGnome firmware I used instead of the regular Marlin based firmware for the UM2+:
